# CNN-Image-Classifier
CYS524/1 Project

Idea of the project is to train the neural network to determine if the picture represents a cup of a Turkish Tea or Ayran. The main objective as it is stated in the final project assignment is to obtain the optimum parameters to increase train and test accuracies.

The dataset will be created manually using the Google Chrome extension ‘Download All Images’. The dataset was created by me and consists of 547 pictures. 276 pictures of tea and 271 pictures of ayran were used. The dataset is accessible on this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aykhanhuseynli/tea-and-ayran-pictures).
